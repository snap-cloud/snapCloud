# Snap!Cloud Installation Guide

## Cloning the repository

First, clone the Snap!Cloud repository into a local folder:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/snap-cloud/snapCloud.git
```

(Use the `--recursive` option so that you can have a working Snap<em>!</em> install.)

**NOTE**: If you forked the repo, make sure that `snap-cloud` is replaced with your **GitHub username**. However, submodules will be from the original author.

## Development

### Steps to look into

When developing on Snap!Cloud on your local machine, the following sections are important:
1. Prereqs
2. Setting up the database
    * The following subsections should be skimmed or read only, no action needed on these:
        * Lapis database configuration
        * Getting Emails (Follow these instructions for a mail server)
        * A Procfile Runner (You will run the commands here at Step 3, when appropriate)
3. Running the Snap!Cloud

The other sections not listed are not needed for development, but may be needed for certain features or deployment.

## Prereqs

For Ubuntu, you can skip this whole section by running the `bin/prereqs.sh` script, that will try to automatically install all dependencies.

**macOS Users**
MacOS users can run `bin/setup-macos`. You will still need to follow all steps after "Setting up a the database" afterwards.
We recommend you use the latest version of `gcc` avaiable.

**Warning for Ubuntu users**
If you are not running an LTS (long term support) Ubuntu release, you will need to look for this line in `bin/prereqs.sh`:

```
echo "deb http://openresty.org/package/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" \
```

And change `$(lsb_release -sc)` for the latest possible LTS codename that's still compatible with your distro. For example, if you're running Ubuntu 20.10 groovy, you'll need to use `focal`, which is the latest LTS release before groovy.

### Lua 5.1

Lua is the language that powers the whole Snap!Cloud. Under Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it by means of APT:

```
# apt-get install lua5.1
```

Please note that you need version 5.1 specifically.

### OpenResty

The Snap!Cloud system is built on top of [Lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis/), a server-side Lua (or MoonScript) web framework that runs on [OpenResty](http://openresty.org), a modified version of Nginx. First of all, you need to [download](http://openresty.org/#Download) and install OpenResty by following its [official install guide](http://openresty.org/#Installation).

### Lapis and extra Lua modules

Once OpenResty is ready, installing Lapis is just a matter of asking the LuaRocks module manager to do that for you. In a Debian/Ubuntu system, you can install them via APT:

```
# apt-get install luarocks
```

Additional Lua packages you need for the Snap!Cloud to work properly are the Bcrypt module and the md5 module used for secure password encryption. You can use LuaRocks to install them all as root:

All Lua dependencies are contained in the rockspec.

### Note About `git` protocols

Some rocks still use the `git://` protocol, which GitHub no longer accepts.
The 'easy' was to get around this is to use a global git configuration:

```
$ git config --global url."https://github".insteadOf git://github
```

### Luarocks macOS

`luarocks` will default to lua 5.3, which we do not use. Instead, `bin/luarocks-macos` "wraps" luarocks with our defaults,
and includes the appropriate C/C++ flags so dependencies compile on recent macOS versions.

You can pass all the same commmands to luarocks, e.g.

```
$ bin/luarocks-macos install snapcloud-dev-0.rockspec
```

```
# luarocks install snapcloud-dev-0.rockspec
```

### Authbind

In order to serve the cloud over HTTPS, we need the cloud user to have permissions over port 443, for which we're going to be using the `authbind` utility.

```
# apt-get install authbind -y
```

### PostgreSQL

The Snap!Cloud backend uses PostreSQL for storage, so you'll need to install it too. Again, under Debian/Ubuntu this is trivial:

```
# apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client
```

#### Getting a self-signed certificate
You should not need to run locally with SSL enabled. However, you may want to do so, if you were testing either the production or staging configurations. In those cases you might want to generate a self-signed certificate so that you can verify SL works locally.

Heroku has a good guide on [generating self-signed certs][heroku-guide].
(The default configuration is for files named host.cert, and host.key. You can adjust the Heroku commands or rename your files afterwards.)

[heroku-guide]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self

## Setting up the database

### Starting up a local PostgreSql server

Follow instructions [here](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-start-stop-restart-postgresql-server.html), depending on your operating system.

### Creating a user and a database

A PostgreSQL script is provided to help you get all tables set up easily. However, you will first need to add a user named `cloud` to both your system and PostgreSQL and create a database named `snapcloud`, owned by that user:

```sh
$ psql postgres

# Enter these in the PSQL command line
> CREATE USER cloud WITH PASSWORD 'snap-cloud-password';
> ALTER ROLE cloud WITH LOGIN;
> CREATE DATABASE snapcloud OWNER cloud;
```

Alternatively, if you are on Linux, you can have postgres become the superuser, but that is not required

```sh
$ sudo -i
# adduser cloud   # } These are inside the Root of Linux, these are not comments
# su - postgres   # } (Note the Root uses the # instead of the $)

# # Then "ctrl D" here (at the same time)

$ psql

# Note: Enter these in the PSQL command line
> CREATE USER cloud WITH PASSWORD 'snap-cloud-password';
> ALTER ROLE cloud WITH LOGIN;
> CREATE DATABASE snapcloud OWNER cloud;
```

### Building the database schema

Continue by logging in as `cloud` and running the provided SQL file in the main Terminal:

```sh
$ psql -U cloud -d snapcloud -a -f cloud.sql
```

Linux users can run the following to set the "cloud" to create a substitute user (after running `sudo -i`) before running the above:

```sh
# su - cloud
```

You then have to apply the Migration file (called `migrations.lua`) by running the following command, applying changes to your PSQL snapcloud tables:

```sh
$ bin/migrations.sh
```

If it all goes well, you should now have all tables properly set up. You can make sure it all worked by firing up the PostgreSQL shell and running the `\dt` command, which should print a list of all tables (`projects` and `users`).

### Lapis database configuration

The above username and password are the default values, defined in `config.lua`. You can override those values by defining environment variables, that lapis will read when the app is booted up.

In development, it's completely fine to stick with these provided values. However, on a production server you must create a much stronger password, which should be stored in an environment variable.


### Getting Emails
The Snap<em>!</em>Cloud sends emails for certain actions, like new user signups and password resets. In order to test those actions, you need an SMTP server.

We've included a configuration to run a local server called [maildev][maildev].

To install maildev, you need node/npm.

Run: (The macOS install script includes this already.)
```sh
$ npm i -g maildev
```

Start maildev by just typing `maildev`:
```sh
$ maildev
```

When you start maildev, all emails sent by the Snap!Cloud will be avaialbe at:
http://localhost:1080

### A Procfile Runner
We've included a Procfile, which declares all the resources needed to run the app, including postgres.

You can use any tool you'd like to run a procfile, but two common ones are [foreman][foreman] or [node-foreman][nf]. These make it really easy to run all the resources:

```sh
$ foreman s[tart] -p 8080 # OR
$ nf start -x 8080
```

You can now point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` (note: `foreman` and `node-forman (nf)` by default goes to 5000 without the `-p` or `-x` port flag).

[nf]: https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman


### Updating Dependencies / Lockfile

To regenerate `luarocks.rock`, use the following command:

```
$ bin/luarocks-macos build snapcloud-dev-0.rockspec --pin
```

## Production Configuration

### SSL
The production instance needs SSL to run. See [certs/README.md](certs/README.md) for details on configuring SSL certificates.

### Setting Environment Variables

SnapCloud will read variables from a file `.env` which contains contains data specific to that system. It should look something like this:

```sh
export LAPIS_ENVIRONMENT=production
export DATABASE_URL=127.0.0.1:5432
export DATABASE_USERNAME=cloud
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=snap-cloud-password
export DATABASE_NAME=snapcloud
export HOSTNAME=cloud.snap.berkeley.edu
```
There are a lot of options defined in `config.lua`. Setting the environment is helpful because you may want to have a "staging" server with a slightly different configuration.

### Giving permissions to use HTTP(S) ports
(This section applies only to Linux machines.)
Authbind allows a user to bind to ports 0-1023. In development, you will likely not need to use authbind as the server defaults to using port 8080 and doesn't need https. However, on the production server, authbind is necessary.

We now need to configure `authbind` so that user `cloud` can start a service over the HTTP and HTTPS ports. To do so, we simply need to create a file and assign its ownership to `cloud`:

```
# touch /etc/authbind/byport/443
# chown cloud:cloud /etc/authbind/byport/443
# chmod +x /etc/authbind/byport/443
# touch /etc/authbind/byport/80
# chown cloud:cloud /etc/authbind/byport/80
# chmod +x /etc/authbind/byport/80
```

## Running the Snap!Cloud

If it all went well, you're now ready to fire up Lapis. While in development, just run this command under your Snap!Cloud local folder.

If you use authbind:
```
$ ./start.sh
```

Otherwise, run Snap!Cloud using the instructions in: "A Procfile Runner"

You will also need to start your Postgres database separately.
When running locally, follow the instructions listed in "Starting up a local PostgreSql server"

## Setting up the Snap!Cloud as a system daemon

We provide a very simple init script that you can use to run the Snap!Cloud as a daemon in your server. You need to edit the `snapcloud_daemon` script so that it starts the cloud under your user first. Find the following line and replace `cloud` by your actual user. If you have followed this guide, this is not necessary.


`runuser -l cloud`

Then use `update-rc.d` to create the necessary symbolic links:

```
$ update-rc.d snapcloud_daemon defaults
```

You can now start and stop the Snap!Cloud by running:

```
$ service snapcloud_daemon [start|stop]
```
### Add sudo access for the `cloud` user

This is done to make it so the cloud user can easily run maintenance scripts.

Add the following line to `/etc/sudoers`

```
cloud        ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service snapcloud_daemon *
```

The `cloud` user may now run `sudo service snapcloud_daemon restart`

### Production Log Rotation

The Snap!Cloud includes a simple logrotation setup that uses the default `logrotate` program. We run this as the `cloud` user, since that is the process that "owns" the log files. The file `bin/logrotate.conf` is a good starting point.

To run it automatically, add the following to the `cloud` user crontab, by running `crontab -e`.

```
0 2 * * * /usr/sbin/logrotate /home/cloud/logrotate.conf --state /home/cloud/logrotate-state
```

This will run the logrotation script at 2AM each night. (You'll want to create the logrotate-state file, and update the paths as necessary.)
