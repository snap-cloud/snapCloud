-- How to translate
-- ----------------
-- Translate each text string to the target language leaving intact the two
-- double quotes.
-- Example: "Log In" should become "Entrar"
--
-- If you need to use a double quote, escape it with a backslash (\")
--
-- The "@" symbol followed by a number represents a parameter that the system
-- will substitute by a value, for example a username.
-- Example: "Welcome, @1!" will become "Welcome, Mary!" when Mary is logged in.
--
-- You need to leave "@" marks intact, but you can change their order in your
-- translation if your language requires so.
